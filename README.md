# Interview Scheduler

## **Interview Scheduler** is a user-friendly, single-page scheduler.

This project was done with the utilization of front-end and back-end languages including `REACT.JS`, `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JSX` using `Webpacks`, `Babel`, `Axios`, along with testing libraries such as `Storybook`, `Webpack Dev Server`, `Jest`, and `Testing Library`. 

The Interview Scheduler is a single page application that allows users to look through randomly-generated appointments booked with Lighthouse Labs. The App diplays the Days of the week, the interviews for selected day, and how many remaining spots are available for the days. Users are able to choose an empty time slot to book an interview with an interviewer from a list of available interviewers, or they can cancel the already booked interviews.
